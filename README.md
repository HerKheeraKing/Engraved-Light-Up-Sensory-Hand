<h1 align="center">Mia-mi – Interactive Light-Up Sensory Hand</h1>

##### <p align="center"> Built from a personal sensory habit I didn’t understand until adulthood, this project blends touch and light to create a calming, tech-driven experience.
</p>

  <p align="center"> This engraved sensory hand is an interactive, light-based component designed to support neurodivergent students through touch and uses color to suggest warm-to-cool sensations.

# How it works:
🖐️ Touch-based interaction: Users place their fingers into engraved slots, triggering capacitive touch input through the MPR121 sensor.

🎨 Color-driven sensory feedback: LEDs transition smoothly from red → pink → purple → blue, using color to suggest warm-to-cool temperature sensations.

🧠 Sensory grounding: The slow color shift is designed to recreate a familiar, soothing hand-on-surface sensation through light and texture.

🔌 Embedded control: An ESP32 manages touch input and LED behavior, starting at blue and transitioning based on interaction timing.

🛠️ Expandable behavior: The system is designed to support future features such as real temperature feedback.

Tools: SolidWorks, Arduino (C/C++), ESP32, 3D Printing, CNC, Soldering
